  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Powers_of_Attorney
continue button field: mn_powers_of_attorney_intro
question: |
  Powers of Attorney
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you give powers of attorney to a trusted person. This person can make the decisions for you about your finances that you pick. In Minnesota, this person will be called your "attorney in fact."
  
  Before you get started, you should gather:
  
  1. The name and address of the person or people you trust and want to give power over your finances.
  1. The _legal description_ of any property you want to give the person you trust authority over.
  
  The interview will help you decide which powers to give to your "attorney-in-fact."
  
  When you are finished, you will need to:
  
  1. Sign the powers of attorney form in front of a notary.
  1. Give copies of the powers of attorney form to the person you are giving power and to the bank or anywhere else you want the person to be allowed to make decisions for you.
  
  Most people take about 20 minutes to finish this interview.
